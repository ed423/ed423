### Hello, I'm Ed (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

I am looking for internships for Summer (May-August) 2022, and Fall (September-December) 2022. Feel free to reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwin-chow-a45754176/) or email (edwinchow1110@gmail.com)!

**Projects that I'm currently working on:**
- A grounding app that aims to reduces stress/anxiety by guiding the user through simple breathing/mental exercises. Mental health is an aspect of life that is often overlooked, and is something that I personally see as vital in my daily life.
- A website that uses NHL api to determine the number of games an NHL team can lose before they are eliminated from the playoffs. As a Vancouver Canucks fan, I was inspired to make this because I wanted to know when to stop hoping that the Canucks can make the playoffs
- My personal portfolio website to showcase the projects that I've worked on and what I'm currently working on.

**What I'm currently learning:**
- JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS
- Python

**Why I use GitHub:**
I use GitHub to track my learning process as well as all my projects, so there may be repositories that I've made during my learning process mixed in with my projects on this GitHub account. 

Thank you for reading!
