### Hello, I'm Ed (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

I am looking for internships for Summer (May-August) 2022, and Fall (September-December) 2022. Feel free to contact me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwin-chow-a45754176/) or email (edwinchow1110@gmail.com)!

**Projects that I'm currently working on:**
- A grounding app that aims to reduces stress/anxiety by guiding the user through simple breathing/mental exercises. Mental health is an aspect of life that is often overlooked, and is something that I personally see as vital in my daily life.
- My personal portfolio website to showcase projects that I'm proud of

**What I'm currently learning:**
- JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS
- Python

**Why I use GitHub:**
- I use GitHub to track my learning process as well as all my projects, so there may be repositories that I've made during my learning process mixed in with my projects on this GitHub account. 

Thank you for reading!
