- Looking for new opportunities!
- I use GitHub to track my learning and progress, as well as all my projects, so there may be repositories that I've made during the learning process mixed in with my projects on this GitHub account.

ed423/ed423 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
