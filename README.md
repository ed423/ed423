### Hello, I'm Ed (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

- I use GitHub to track my learning process as well as all my projects, so there may be repositories that I've made during my learning process mixed in with my projects on this GitHub account. 

- I am looking for internships for Summer(May-August), and Fall (September-December) 2022. Feel free to contact me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwin-chow-a45754176/) or email (edwinchow1110@gmail.com)!

Thank you for reading!
