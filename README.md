### Hello, I'm Ed (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

**Projects that I'm currently working on:**
- A grounding app that aims to reduces stress/anxiety through simple breathing/mental exercises. Mental health is an aspect of life that is often overlooked, and is something that I personally see as vital in my daily life.

**What I'm currently learning:**
- JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS
- Python

- I use GitHub to track my learning process as well as all my projects, so there may be repositories that I've made during my learning process mixed in with my projects on this GitHub account. 

- I am looking for internships for Summer(May-August), and Fall (September-December) 2022. Feel free to contact me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwin-chow-a45754176/) or email (edwinchow1110@gmail.com)!

Thank you for reading!
